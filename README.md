# Shortest-Path-Parking-Algo
This project involves finding the shortest path between starting and ending nodes in a parking lot. The developed algorithm takes into account variables such as time taken for parking, parking speed, and specific type of parking. As a part of my solution, I used an implementation of Dijsktra's Shortest Path Algorithm
